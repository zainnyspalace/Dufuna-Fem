Hello World!
My name is Boluwatife Oluwagbamila.

I have been able to push my first task to Github.

At the end of this program, I hope to become a full stack developer.
I want to be able to design reactive and responsive websites.
I want to be able to build my portfolio.
I want to get a high paying full stack developer job.
I also want to be able to work remotely rather than have a 9-5 job.
I want to be a freelance designer so I can have another source of income apart from my salary.
Finally, I want to work with my tech friends on Github.
